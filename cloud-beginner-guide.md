## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services — servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics — over the internet (“the cloud”).

---

## 📦 Main Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) → Virtual machines, storage, networks.  
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) → Application hosting and development platforms.  
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service) → Ready-to-use applications (Office 365, Gmail).  

---

## 🔑 Benefits
- Lower upfront costs
- Pay as you go
- Scalability
- Global access
- Built-in redundancy

---

## 🏗️ Leading Providers
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

## 📌 Key Concepts
- **VM (Virtual Machine):** A virtualized server running in the cloud.

- **Networking:** Securely connecting apps and services.  
- **Identity & Access:** Managing users and permissions.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Create a free trial account in Azure, AWS or GCP.  
2. Deploy your first Virtual Machine (VM).  
3. Explore storage options (Blob, S3, Google Storage).  
4. Learn to configure permissions (IAM / RBAC).
